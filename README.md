# Dungeons Of Izalia
A Roguelike written entirely in python using the PYNE engine; a custom engine based off of pygame.

## Purpose
Dungeons of Izalia is meant to merge together traditional roguelike dungeoncrawling and storytelling with JRPG-style combat. This game is purely a passion projectt and aims to combine my love for the two genres.

## Milestones
- [x] Implement an overworld, dungeons, basic combat, basic dialogue, etc.
- [x] Flesh out worldbuilding
- [ ] More Milestones :)
